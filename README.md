### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### Aim: To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Straightforward Prompts:
    - ‚Ä¢	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
    - 	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."

 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     ‚Ä¢	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
     ‚Ä¢	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    ‚Ä¢	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    ‚Ä¢	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
4. Missing Word Prompting:

Prompt engineering Types

Prompt Type	Description	Example Prompt	Explanation / Use Case
1. Straightforward Prompting	A direct and simple prompt that asks the AI exactly what you want, without giving extra context or examples.	üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúSummarize the article on blockchain technology in 100 words.‚Äù	This is the most basic form of prompting ‚Äî easy to use and fast, but may lack depth or accuracy if the task is complex. Best for short, factual, or general questions.
2. Tabular Format Prompting	The prompt instructs the AI to organize information in a table (rows and columns). This improves clarity, comparison, and readability.	üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúList the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain technology in a table format with two columns.‚Äù	Useful for structured output like comparisons, pros & cons, data summaries, or evaluation results. Helps students quickly grasp key differences.
3. Missing Word Prompting	The prompt contains an incomplete sentence or blank, encouraging the AI to fill in the missing information based on context.	üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúBlockchain ensures data integrity through a ______ mechanism.‚Äù ‚Üí (AI fills: ‚Äòconsensus‚Äô)	Helps test AI‚Äôs understanding or knowledge recall. Commonly used in quizzes, fill-in-the-blank exercises, and language learning tasks.
4. Preceding Question Prompting	The AI is first given a related or guiding question before the main question, helping it reason or narrow down context for better answers.	üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúWhat is the main goal of blockchain technology? Now explain how decentralization achieves that goal.‚Äù	Encourages step-by-step reasoning. Useful for educational and reasoning-based tasks ‚Äî improves coherence and logical flow of answers.

Summary
Straight forward prompts ‚Üí direct and simple.
Tabular prompts ‚Üí structured and easy to compare.
Missing word prompts ‚Üí test AI‚Äôs knowledge or understanding.
Preceding question prompts ‚Üí guide the AI‚Äôs reasoning path.



# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
